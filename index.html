					I am 4<sup>th</sup> year bachelor student in Information Systems at the University of Sofia. <br />
					I am also working as a Web developer in
					<a href="http://komfo.com/" target="_blank">Komfo</a>.
					I work on the Komfo Platform - large and interesting project together with very smart people. <br />
					I like the various and provoking projects you should think much on before starting to do something,
					so that everything to be done in the best way possible. <br />
					I love my girlfriend, to ride bicycle and to drive my red car. :-) <br />
					On the 30<sup>th</sup> of June 2012 I took a MENSA test and got IQ 154, 99<sup>th</sup> percentile.

					I can not complain of not participating in projects. <br />
					I develop interesting web sites that help me build my skills and way of thinking. <br />
					In my opinion the thinking is an important part of the definition for "developer". <br />
					Look at my projects, you may like some of them! :-)

					For these several years that I am working hard in the area of web development
					I have built the following skills I try to expand: <br />
					Web development: PHP, JavaScript <img src="images/5star.png" alt="Knows a lot of things" title="Knows a lot of things" /><br />
					Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MongoDB, DB2 <img src="images/5star.png" alt="Knows a lot of things" title="Knows a lot of things" /><br />
					Web design: HTML, CSS, XML and XSL <img src="images/5star.png" alt="Knows a lot of things" title="Knows a lot of things" /><br />
					I have some knowledge in 
					C++, Perl, Node.js, Objective-C, C# and a dozen of other fun or not so fun technologies. <br />
					I have worked on large projects in teams and on my own.
					I understand the best things are slow and hard to be developed so I prefer working in a team.

					As a Web developer I use PHP and JavaScript to build web sites. I try to be member of interesting projects. <br />
					Maybe it is normal not to be able to include everything I have been working on
					and all the technologies I have used and know
					in a personal web site so I have included only the most important ones. <br />
					More for my work as well as samples you can find on github:

					I worked as Network administrator for about half a year.
					At the moment I am dedicated to my other passion I talked about upwards. <br />
					Actually the job is cooler than it seems. <br />
					Usually the women part has Internet problems. Why only their's Internet makes problems - I do not know.

					If you win the first time try the Medium level

					I wrote the game for a weekend in the summer of 2011. and although it was thought to be written in JavaScript I changed my mind and got it in PHP. It is easier!<br />
